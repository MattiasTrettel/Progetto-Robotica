A number of objects (e.g., mega-blocks) are stored without any specific order on a stand
(initial stand) located within the workspace of a robotic manipulator. The manipulator is an
anthropomorphic arm, with a spherical wrist and a three-fingered gripper as end-effector.
The objects can belong to different classes but have a known geometry. The objective of the
project is to use the manipulator to pick the objects in sequence and to position them on a
different stand according to a specified order (final stand). A calibrated 3D sensor is used to
locate the different objects and to detect their mutual position in the initial stand.
The project is organised as a sequence of assignments of increasing complexity. The
minimum requirement to pass the exam is that at least assignments 1 and 2 are completed.
Each assignment is associated with some performance indicators that are used in the
grading of the project.
